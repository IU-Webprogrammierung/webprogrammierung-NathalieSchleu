# Nathalie Schleu Website

This is the repository for Nathalie Schleu's website.

## How to start

Since the `fetch` API is used to dynamically load content into the page, the page must be hosted on a server in order to show the content correctly.

If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can install the extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to launch a local development server.
Once you have installed the live server, you can start the website from any html file, e.g right-click on the `index.html` and select `Open with Live Server`.
